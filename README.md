# Breakr

Interval training to increase mindful productivity while working, stressing the importance of taking regular breaks. With Breakr you a timer for each and yield extraordinary results! 

## Motivation

*Studies show that taking a break once an hour increases our work productivity. After a while, our brain becomes numb to constant stimulation and it becomes harder to focus. A break can serve as creative fuel so that we are able to come back to the task at hand renewed and reenergized. Breakr can assure that happens.
*Breakr allows users to set an interval for their work time, after which a popup notification and sound will alert the user that it is time to take a break. Set a new timer for your break period and be alerted when it is time to get back to work.
*Users have the option to create an account and login. In doing so, they will gain access to their statistics to track their work and break times over the course of TIME INTERVALLLLLLLL

### API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

#### Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
